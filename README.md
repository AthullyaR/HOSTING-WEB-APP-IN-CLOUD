- AWS Amplify enables frontend web and mobile developers to quickly and easily build full-stack applications on AWS. Amplify provides two services: Amplify Hosting and Amplify Studio.
- AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including      server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and logging. With Lambda, we only need to do supply your code in one of the language runtimes that Lambda supports.
- Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API developers can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data       
  stored in the AWS Cloud.
- Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve 
  any level of request traffic.
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can centrally manage permissions that control which AWS resources users can access.
